# Odyssey
One place destination for all your travel memoirs! 

## Inspiration
Ever wanted to document your visit to a memorable restaurant? Or a family trip that you cherish? Or some localite who made your day? Say no more we've got you covered! We sought to preserve all the long-lost treasurable memories.

## What it does
Odyssey is a one-stop destination for all the memories that fade over time. In this fast-moving world, we tend to forget the past.  We can document our journey with images, texts as well videos from all the places which we travel which would, in turn, help one reminisce. One can register or login into this app and enjoy the memories they once made. A virtual diary that can be one's companion as and when required. This web app comes with the google maps integration which connects one place to another and marks the ones already visited with a flag so that travelers know what all places they can visit the next time. Travelers can also check out the average climatic conditions of a particular place in case they made up their mind to visit it.

## How we built it
We built this web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Integrated a few APIs including, Google Maps API

## Challenges we ran into
We were completely new to web development, with only some basic knowledge on HTML/CSS and JS. We explored Google Maps API and also learnt how we can integrate frontend and backend in a smooth manner.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the full-stack web application ready and fully functional within such a short time interval by communicating and coordinating is what we're most proud of. We also accomplished integrating the google maps API which was most definitely fun working with.

## What we learned
We got to learn quite a lot of things which include working with APIs and Databases. Also, we acquired skills in frontend and backend technologies and got to apply those in our web application. 

## What's next for Odyssey
Addressing some security concerns, is up on our Todo list. Also we would like to extend such that like minded people at any given location can meet-up and have some fun talking to each other
